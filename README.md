# Flight Search Web App

This is my first full-stack project that connects a client-side React application to a server-side Express backend. The project is a simple and practical demonstration of how a client and server interact in a full-stack web application.

## ✈️ Project Overview
The project simulates a flight search website where users can:
- Search for flights by **destination**.
- Search for flights by **origin**.
- Toggle the display of all available flights with a single button click.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
### Frontend:
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Fetch API**: To communicate with the backend server.

### Backend:
- **Node.js**: For the server-side runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: For handling API routes.
- **MongoDB**: To store flight data (optional for enhanced data management).

## 🌟 Features
- **Flight Search by Destination:** Allows users to search flights based on the destination city.
- **Flight Search by Origin:** Enables users to filter flights by the origin city.
- **Display All Flights Toggle:** Displays or hides all available flights with a single button click.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Frontend**: 
   - Users interact with a responsive React-based interface.
   - Search input fields and buttons send requests to the backend server.
   - Results are dynamically rendered in the UI.

2. **Backend**:
   - Handles requests from the client.
   - Performs filtering and data retrieval based on user inputs.
   - Sends the relevant flight data back to the frontend.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
This project helped me understand the basics of full-stack development, including:
- Setting up and managing a React frontend.
- Handling API requests and responses with Fetch.
- Setting up a simple backend server using Node.js and Express.
- Managing data flow between the client and the server.

## 🎉 Next Steps
In the future, I plan to enhance this project by:
- Adding a **real-time flight database** with MongoDB.
- Implementing authentication for users.
- Creating a more detailed flight booking system.
